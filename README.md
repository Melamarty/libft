Since in most 42 projects we can't use any of the standard C library functions,
the goal of this first project is to replicate some of the usual functions ourselves, 
as well as some additional functions.

those functions are :

• isalpha                  • isdigit
• isalnum                  • isascii
• isprint                  • strlen
• memset                   • bzero
• memcpy
• memmove
• strlcpy
• strlcat
• toupper
• tolower
• strchr
• strrchr
• strncmp
• memchr
• memcmp
• strnstr
• atoi
• calloc
• strdup
